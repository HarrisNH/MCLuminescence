- Decide dt from lifetime
- Make distance calculation more efficient - how?
- Introduce new holes as product of background radiation
  
- Define time_temp plot objectives (what are we estimating, what do we know)
- Find objective function 
- Figure out how to use differetial equations to estimate parameters



- What happens:
- In the beginning electrons are created many will be close to holes but at some point we reach a time where 
- only electrons left are those that are far away from holes.
- This means that we start only seeing filling events. Those filling events
- become more and more spaced out as the box fills up
Is it conceptually wrong to subtract total time passed instead of time since electron was created when calculating lifetime-time passed


it seems like when he talks about rho prime he is talking about the density of holes in the box - make sure you fix this for the BG experiment
