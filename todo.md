- Decide dt from lifetime
- Make distance calculation more efficient - how?
- Introduce new holes as product of background radiation
  
- Define time_temp plot objectives (what are we estimating, what do we know)
- Find objective function 
- Figure out how to use differetial equations to estimate parameters
