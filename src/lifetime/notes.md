Find correct rho
try setting same lifetime for all and see if it works

think about only recalulating actualized lifetime for the electrons getting new hole



estimating parameters:
s,E, rho
We get time temp data from experiment which we can use to estimate the parameters
See if we can define a good objective function.


questions:
What do we do if we see no recombinations
